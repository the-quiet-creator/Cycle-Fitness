        <h1>Cycle Fitness Story</h1>
        <div id="about_paragraphs">
        <p>This company, as well as many others was made from a love of biking by a group of friends. Together we started by working out of eachothers garages, taking equipment to and from each place and trying to slowly build up a name for ourselfs as a serious business. Fixing and selling bikes, and they ultimately making a name for ourselfs, we knew we had a shot. We took our passion of biking and traveled to different cities to try and spread the word and gain support and customers, and soon this paid off for us. Soon we started a small store less than 500 square feet in size, carrying more than 100 types of bikes, as well as a repair shop in a very tight area. This was a stressful, but great time for all of us.</p>
       <br>
        <p>With money in our pockets after our first major success, we took to find another place that we give us another great start to the rest of our businesses life. And with this new dream in mind, we found our place on Avenue of Americas. With many different types of bikes, and a repair shop, we have set out to become the best bike shop that New York and the surrounding states have seen. Now, we have trips, seminars, and the best customers that we could have ever imagined!  Thank you to all of our loyal customers, and our one time customers. Without all of them we would have no need to write this. The Cycle Fitness dream is now a reality for us. Thanks for watching us grow and expand so that we can continue to give the best service and care to the bikes in your life.</p>
