While we offer amazing deals on a wide selection of bikes, we at Cycle Fitness realize that bikes are still really expensive. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why we decided to introduce our newest seminar, the bike Maintenance seminar! &nbsp;Starting in 2015, we will be hosting a Bike Maintenance seminar on the second Monday of each month. &nbsp;During this seminar, we will teach new and experienced bikers how to properly maintain their bikes. &nbsp;This hour long seminar costs 5$ and lasts about an hour. &nbsp;Since Bike maintenance can require the use various tools, we require that all children twelve and younger be accompanied by an adult.</strong></div>
